**NLP Pipeline and Model Evolution**

*   The typical **NLP pipeline** consists of data ingestion, data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.
*   **Data preprocessing** includes text preprocessing, text encoding, and text embedding.
*   The evolution of NLP models has progressed significantly:
    *   From RNN (1987), LSTM (1997), GRU (2014), and EPD (2014)
    *   To Encoder-Decoders with attention (2016)
    *   And then to Transformers (2017-2018), including models like BERT and GPT (2019-2020).

**Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning**

*   **Transfer learning** involves applying a pre-trained model to new data.
*   **Fine-tuning** is a transfer learning technique where a pre-trained model is loaded and further trained with new data.
*   This can involve loading a base model and adding layers for fine-tuning.

**Transformers**

*   Transformers utilise **self-attention mechanisms**.
*   They require **large amounts of data and extensive training**.
*   Transformers are versatile and can be applied to:
    *   Conversational AI
    *   Text classification
    *   Question answering
    *   Language translation
    *   Text summarisation.

**Computer Vision**

*   Key tasks in **computer vision** include:
    *   Image classification
    *   Object detection
    *   Object segmentation
    *   Object tracking
    *   Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
*   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are employed for feature extraction.
*   Image recognition using CNNs relies on pattern recognition.

**Word Embedding and Self-Attention**

*   **Word embedding** represents words as vectors.
*   **Contextual embedding** and **dynamic embedding** are types of self-attention.
*   **Self-attention** uses query, key, and value to understand relationships between words.

**Language Models (LM)**

*   **Language Models** can be combined with transformers to improve text summarisation.
*   Large Language Models (LLMs) benefit from transformers and large datasets.



# Learning Architectures: RNN, CNN, and Transformers

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to process sequential data. They are widely used in **text processing, speech recognition, and time-series analysis**, as they can maintain contextual information.

---

## 📌 **Types of RNNs**
RNNs come in different architectures to improve efficiency and accuracy:

### 🔹 **Stacked RNNs**
Stacked RNNs consist of multiple RNN layers stacked on top of each other to **learn complex representations** from sequential data.

### 🔹 **Bidirectional RNNs**
Bidirectional RNNs process input in both forward and backward directions, helping capture **context from both past and future words**.

### 🔹 **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**
Sequence-to-sequence models **convert one sequence into another** and can handle both **fixed and variable-length sequences**.

---

## 📌 **Sequence to Sequence Learning**
RNNs can be categorized based on input/output structure:

👉 **Many-to-One** → Used for **text classification** (e.g., sentiment analysis, spam detection).  
👉 **One-to-Many** → Applied in **image captioning**.  
👉 **Many-to-Many** → Used in **POS tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), text summarization, machine translation, and question answering**.

---

## 📌 **How RNNs Work**
RNNs process sequences **one element at a time**, maintaining a **hidden state** that stores relevant information.

### ✨ **Example of RNN Processing**
Let's consider an example sentence:
> **"I love AI"**  
The hidden state updates as each word is processed.

⚠️ **Limitation: Vanishing Gradient Problem**

### 📈 **What is the Vanishing Gradient Problem?**
When training deep RNNs, gradients (used to update model parameters) can become extremely small as they are backpropagated through many layers. This causes:

- **Slow or no learning**: The weights of earlier layers do not get updated significantly.
- **Loss of long-term dependencies**: The network fails to remember information from the beginning of a long sequence.
- **Difficulty in training deep networks**: Deep RNNs become ineffective due to poor gradient flow.

### ✅ **Solutions to Vanishing Gradient Problem**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks** → Introduce gates that regulate the flow of information.
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)** → A simpler alternative to LSTMs that also address vanishing gradients.
- **Use of Batch Normalization** → Helps stabilize and speed up training.

---

## 📌 **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
LSTMs solve the **vanishing gradient problem** by introducing a **memory cell** that allows for better retention of long-term dependencies.

### 🔹 **Key Features of LSTM**
- **Memory Cell**: Maintains long-term dependencies.
- **Gates**:
  - **Forget Gate** → Decides what information to discard.
  - **Input Gate** → Decides what new information to store.
  - **Output Gate** → Controls the output based on memory state.

### 📝 **Example: LSTM in Python**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Create an LSTM model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(100, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Display model summary
model.summary()
```

---

## 📌 **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**
GRUs are a simpler alternative to LSTMs with fewer parameters, making them **faster to train**.

### 🔹 **LSTM vs GRU**
| Feature   | LSTM  | GRU  |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Complexity | Higher | Lower |
| Training Time | Slower | Faster |
| Performance | Better for long sequences | Faster with fewer parameters |

### 📝 **Example: GRU in Python**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GRU

# Create a GRU model
model = Sequential([
    GRU(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(100, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.summary()
```

---

## 📌 **Transformers: The Evolution Beyond RNNs**
Transformers **do not rely on recurrence** but instead use **self-attention mechanisms** to process sequences in parallel.

### 🔹 **Key Features of Transformers**
- **Self-Attention** → Determines importance of different words in a sequence.
- **Parallel Processing** → Speeds up training.
- **Better Long-Term Dependency Handling** → Overcomes RNN limitations.

### 📝 **Example: Transformer Model in Python**
```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Load a pre-trained transformer model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Tokenize a sample sentence
text = "Transformers are powerful models for NLP tasks."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Get model output
outputs = model(**inputs)
print(outputs.last_hidden_state.shape)
```

---

## 📌 **Conclusion**
RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs are powerful for sequential data processing, but **transformers have revolutionized the field** with their efficiency and accuracy.

👉 RNNs → **Good for simple sequences**  
👉 LSTMs/GRUs → **Better for long-term dependencies**  
👉 Transformers → **State-of-the-art for NLP and sequence tasks**
